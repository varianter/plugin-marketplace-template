description: Create a product spec from a GitHub issue in this repository by applying the shared `write-product-spec` workflow with Oz-specific issue context and output paths. Use when an issue should be turned into a product spec artifact stored under `specs/GH<issue-number>/product.md` and the agent should prepare file changes only, without creating commits or pull requests itself unless a cloud workflow explicitly asks for it.

# create-product-spec

Create a product spec from a GitHub issue for this repository.

## Overview

This skill is a thin Oz wrapper around the shared product-spec workflow:

- `write-product-spec`

Use that shared skill as the base behavior and structure unless this wrapper overrides it. Keep the same emphasis on precise user-facing behavior, invariants, edge cases, validation, and open questions.

The Oz-specific differences are:

- the primary input is a GitHub issue, not a Linear issue
- the output path is `specs/GH<issue-number>/product.md`
- `issue_comments.md` and triggering-comment context are first-class inputs
- a workflow may also request a structured PR metadata file in `pr-metadata.json`
- do not create or edit Linear issues as part of this workflow

## Inputs

Expect issue details in the prompt, including the issue number, title, description, labels, assignees, and optional prior discussion captured in `issue_comments.md`.

If a triggering comment or other workflow-provided comment context is present, treat it as additional context, not as a silent override of the issue body. Resolved decisions from comments can refine the spec; unresolved disagreements should remain explicit open questions.

## Process

1. Start from the shared `write-product-spec` guidance and follow its structure and writing standards unless this wrapper says otherwise.
2. Read the issue details carefully. If `issue_comments.md` exists, review it for clarifications, prior decisions, and issue-comment nuance that should influence the spec.
3. Inspect the repository enough to understand the current user workflow and likely scope before writing the spec.
4. Create or update `specs/GH<issue-number>/product.md`.
5. Keep the product spec focused on intended behavior and user-facing requirements. Use the shared skill's sections as the baseline, adapted to this repository and issue format. At minimum, cover:
   - summary
   - problem
   - goals
   - non-goals or scope boundaries
   - concrete user experience and behavior requirements
   - success criteria
   - validation
   - open product questions
6. If design context such as a Figma link is present in the issue description or comments, include it. If no design context exists, make that absence explicit rather than silently omitting it.
7. Do not include implementation details, file-level changes, or technical design. Those belong in the tech spec.
8. Do not implement the feature or modify production code as part of this task. Limit changes to the product spec artifact. Treat temporary context files such as `issue_comments.md` as scratch input only and do not commit them.
9. Do not include issue number references (e.g. `(#N)`, `Refs #N`) in commit messages. The issue is already linked in the PR.
10. If the prompt asks for it, write `pr-metadata.json` at the repository root containing a JSON object with the fields `branch_name`, `pr_title`, and `pr_summary`. The `pr_summary` should summarize the product and technical planning clearly enough that reviewers can use it directly as the PR body. For spec-only PRs, include a non-closing reference to the source issue such as `Related issue: #<issue-number>` rather than closing keywords like `Closes` or `Fixes`.
11. Default behavior: do not stage files, create commits, push branches, open pull requests, or use the GitHub CLI. If the prompt explicitly instructs you to publish a named branch, you may commit and push exactly the requested spec changes to that branch, but still do not open or update the pull request yourself unless the prompt explicitly asks for it.
12. In your final response, provide a brief summary of the product spec and call out any assumptions or open questions so the workflow can reuse that summary when creating the PR.

## Outputs

- Leave the repository with the new or updated product spec file ready to be committed by the workflow.
- When requested by the prompt, leave a ready-to-use `pr-metadata.json` with `branch_name`, `pr_title`, and `pr_summary`.
- If the issue is underspecified, still produce the best possible product spec and clearly capture assumptions or open questions in the spec file and final response.
