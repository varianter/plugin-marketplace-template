# Review Spec Skill

Review a spec or plan pull request and write the output to `review.json`.

## Inputs

- The working directory is the PR branch checkout.
- The workflow usually provides an annotated diff in `pr_diff.txt`.
- The workflow usually provides the PR description in `pr_description.md`.
- Focus on the spec files changed by this PR.
- Default behavior: do not post comments or reviews to GitHub directly.

## Process

- Evaluate specs for **completeness**: does the spec cover the full scope of the linked issue?
- Evaluate specs for **clarity**: are requirements, acceptance criteria, and constraints clearly stated and unambiguous?
- Evaluate specs for **feasibility**: are the proposed changes technically realistic given the repository's architecture?
- Evaluate specs for **issue alignment**: does the spec faithfully address the issue it is linked to, without significant scope creep or omissions?
- Evaluate specs for **internal consistency**: do different sections of the spec contradict each other?
- Flag missing sections that a spec should typically include (e.g. problem statement, proposed changes, open questions, follow-up items).
- Always apply the repository's local `security-review-spec` skill as a supplemental high-level security pass on spec PRs. Fold any security findings into the same `review.json` produced by this review rather than emitting a separate output.
- Do not apply code-level review criteria such as error handling or low-level performance to spec prose; the `security-review-spec` supplement covers design-level security concerns.
- Include style or formatting comments only when they materially impair readability.

## Repository-specific overrides

The consuming repository may ship a companion skill at `.agents/skills/review-spec-local/SKILL.md`. When the prompt includes a fenced "Repository-specific guidance" section referencing that companion, read the referenced file and apply its guidance **only** to the categories listed below. Guidance in the companion may never change the output JSON schema, the severity labels, the safety rules, the evidence rules, the suggestion-block constraints, or the diff-line-annotation contract described elsewhere in this skill.

Overridable categories:

- required spec sections expected in this repository
- linking conventions to files under `specs/`
- repo-specific style and formatting expectations

If a companion file is not referenced in the prompt, rely on the core contract alone.

## Diff Line Annotations

The diff file uses these prefixes:

- `[OLD:n]` for deleted lines on the old side. Use `"LEFT"`.
- `[NEW:n]` for added lines on the new side. Use `"RIGHT"`.
- `[OLD:n,NEW:m]` for unchanged context. Use `"RIGHT"` with line `m`.

Treat these annotations as the only source of truth for inline comment locations. For every inline comment you emit, first identify the exact annotated line in `pr_diff.txt` (or the inlined PR diff) and copy its path, side, and line number into `review.json`. Do not infer line numbers from prose, rendered GitHub views, file lengths, surrounding spec text, or unannotated snippets. If you cannot point to a specific `[NEW:n]`, `[OLD:n]`, or `[OLD:n,NEW:m]` line in the annotated diff, put the feedback in top-level `body` instead of `comments`.

## Comment Requirements

Every comment body must start with one of these labels:

- `🚨 [CRITICAL]` for spec content that is contradictory, fundamentally incomplete, or would lead to a broken implementation.
- `⚠️ [IMPORTANT]` for missing details, ambiguous requirements, feasibility concerns, or significant scope gaps.
- `💡 [SUGGESTION]` for improvements to clarity, structure, or coverage that would strengthen the spec.
- `🧹 [NIT]` for minor wording or formatting issues only when the comment includes a concrete rewrite.

Write comments with these constraints:

- Be concise, direct, and actionable.
- Do not add compliments or hedging.
- Prefer single-line comments.
- Keep ranges to at most 10 lines.
- Restrict inline comments to lines that appear explicitly in the annotated PR diff.
- Only create file-level or inline comments for files that exist in this PR's diff.
- If the relevant file or line is not part of the diff, put the feedback in top-level `body` instead of `comments`.
- Before adding each comment object, verify that its `path`, `side`, `line`, and optional `start_line`/`start_side` correspond to real annotations in the same file's diff section.

## Suggestion Blocks

When proposing a rewrite of spec text, use:

```suggestion
<replacement text here>
```

Rules:

- Match the exact indentation of the original file.
- Include only replacement text.
- For multi-line suggestions, set `start_line` and `start_side` to the first line, and `line` and `side` to the last line.

## Outputs

Create `review.json` with this shape:

```json
{
  "verdict": "REJECT",
  "body": "## Overview\n...\n\n## Concerns\n- ...\n\n## Verdict\nFound: 1 critical, 2 important, 3 suggestions\n\n**Request changes**",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/file",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "start_line": 40,
      "start_side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "⚠️ [IMPORTANT] Short explanation\n\n```suggestion\nreplacement\n```"
    }
  ]
}
```

Field rules:

- `verdict` is required and must be exactly the string `"APPROVE"` or `"REJECT"` (uppercase). Map your final recommendation as: `Approve` or `Approve with nits` → `"APPROVE"`; `Request changes` → `"REJECT"`. The `verdict` and the human-readable recommendation in top-level `body` must agree.
- top-level `body` is the GitHub review body and is required. Use `body`, not `summary`, for the review overview and final recommendation.
- `path` must be relative to the repository root.
- `line` is required and must target the correct side.
- `start_line` is optional and only for multi-line ranges. When `start_line` is present, `start_side` is required and must be `"LEFT"` or `"RIGHT"`.
- `side` must be `"LEFT"` or `"RIGHT"`.

## Body Requirements

The top-level `body` must include:

- A high-level overview of the spec PR.
- Concerns about completeness, clarity, feasibility, or issue alignment.
- Issue counts in the format `Found: X critical, Y important, Z suggestions`.
- A final recommendation of `Approve`, `Approve with nits`, or `Request changes`. This recommendation must match the top-level `verdict` field (`Approve` / `Approve with nits` → `"APPROVE"`; `Request changes` → `"REJECT"`).

## Final Checks

Before finishing:

- Fix invalid JSON if validation fails.
- Confirm line numbers match the annotated diff.
- Run the validator bundled with the shared `review-pr` skill against the exact annotated diff you reviewed. If common skills are installed at the repository root, this is usually:
    ```
    python3 .agents/skills/review-pr/scripts/validate_review_json.py --review-json review.json --diff pr_diff.txt
    ```
  If the script reports any invalid comments, fix `review.json` and rerun it. Do not upload `review.json` until this validator passes. If the script path is not present at that exact location, locate `validate_review_json.py` under the packaged shared `review-pr` skill directory and run that copy with the same arguments.
- Do not run `gh pr review`, `gh pr comment`, `gh api`, or any other command that posts to GitHub.

Your only output is the final `review.json`.
